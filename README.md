## Roadmap

## Development

### Drupal

- Use your favourite Drupal 8 dev environment.
- Enable the React Calendar module.
- Configure CORS to allow `* | localhost:3000`.

### React

1. cd in _react_calendar/js/src_
2. Install dependencies with `yarn install`.
3. Copy the _constants/.env.example.js_ file to _constants/.env.local.js_ 
and set there your Drupal 8 development site url.
It will be used while debugging React as a standalone app for JSON API requests.
4. Edit _App.js_ or the components.
5. Run `yarn start` to start the React development server 
and test your app outside of Drupal (localhost:3000).
6. Run `php build.php` to bundle the dist js and css.
